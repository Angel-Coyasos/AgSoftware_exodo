                <p>There are several extension for Tag Manager available for Magento 2. It was overwhelming figuring out
                    which module is the best or the right one. They all looked good to me. Due to the feature set and
                    asking around about the reputation of weltpixel, it was highly recommended that I use this solution.
                    I installed it and I am impressed!!!! I've used many modules in the past, but this one goes above
                    and beyond. The developers really put some thought into their solution. They didn't just develop the
                    extension, they have a full understanding of how Google Analytics and Tag Manager works. I didn't
                    understand this about their solution until I installed it and was it magically configure all the
                    things I could have easily spent days trying to figure out and tweak. Installing the module and
                    putting in my account codes was all that was needed and the module did the rest. Kudo's - highly
                    impressive solution!!!!!</p>
